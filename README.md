# Resume Builder

A Modern Web App to Create, Edit, and Export Resumes in Real-Time.

This project I focused on learning React and on building a **scalable React application** with modular components, form handling, and dynamic sections â€” designed with an emphasis on clean UI/UX and practical usability.

## Features

- Add, Edit, and Delete Resume Sections (General Info, Links, Skills, Education, Experience)
- Manage Tasks for each Experience dynamically
- Live Preview of your resume while editing
- Collapsible editor sections for clean organization
- Export-ready format (easy to extend for PDF/print)
- Responsive and Simple UI
